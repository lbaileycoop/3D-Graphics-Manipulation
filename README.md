# 3D-Graphics-Manipulation
Description
  - This project was completed during a programming class, which I took at the University Of Vermont. The project involves the 3D graphic    manipulation of a cube. The source code given to me was able to draw the front face of the cube, so it was just a square in 2D. The square could rotate in the positive x-direction, but not in any other direction. 

My Contribution
  1. First, I was instructed to edit the Cubes initVectors method in order to draw the other five faces of the cube. This task helped to solidify my understanding of the correct order that the indices of the cube.
  2. Second, I was also instructed to edit the file ``engine.cpp`` in order to implement the rotation in the other x-direction and both y-directions. in order to make the cube fully rotatable by using the arrow keys on your computer.
  3. Lastly, I was instructed to edit the function processInput, which was in the file ``engine.cpp`` in order to make the user move forward and backward by pressing the g and s keys on their computer.
